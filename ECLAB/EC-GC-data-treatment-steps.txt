How to analyse EC-GC-measurement

EC-analysis
1) plot PEIS, which is the first file to be generated 
   [Example - PEIS SINGLE]
3) Plot j, Vref, VRHE and ZIR over time without GC injections
   [Example - CA and iR-DROP SINGLE]
   * plot IV vs time
   * plot Ru and Ohmic Drop vs time
   * plot Ru and Ohmic Drop vs potential

GC-analysis
2) plot raw files with python (with and without the initial 
with injection, since this will show if any of the gases were
to begin with [Example - GCPerkin Elmer Peak plotting.py]
4) Analyse GC spectra - one rst file at a time and create 'XXXX - GC Summary.excel'
5) Plot j over time with GC injections
   [Example - CA and FE SINGLE]
   * plot IV vs time
   * plot IV vs timestamp
   * plot FE
   * plot Tafel plot that compares with Ezra's and Jaramillos data
