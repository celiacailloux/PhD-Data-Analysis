Copy EC_MS to a directory on your computer. Add that directory to your system's PYTHONPATH. In ubuntu, this is done by editing .bashrc and adding the following line:
export PYTHONPATH="{PYTHONPATH}:<containing_directory>" 
and then, in bash:
$source .bashrc
After that, you can use all of the functions and classes in EC_MS globally on your computer with a "from EC_MS import <function>" line in a python script.
